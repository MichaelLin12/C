The Standard Library Function strlen(s) finds the length of a string
Strings are technically character arrays
strlen and other string functions are declared in the standard header <string.h>
A string constant or string literal is a sequence of zero or more characters surrounded by double quotes
Also strcat(s,t) concatenates t to end of s


enumeration constants are like 
ex.

enum boolean {NO,YES}
enum escapes {BELL='\a',BACKSPACE='\b',TAB='\t'}
enum months {Jan=1,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun}

Names in different enumerations must be distinct, values do not

**The const keyword can be used to create constants


The relational operations are
> < >= <=

They all have the same precedence and just below them are == and !=
Relational operations have lower precedence than arithmetic operations


The standard header <ctype.h> defines a family of functions that provide tests and conversions that are independent of character set
ex.
tolower(c)
isdigit(c)

The standard header <math.h> contains standard math functions


The Following is the Precedence Table:
