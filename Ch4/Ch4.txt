atof(string to float) is an extension of atoi(string to integer) which is in stdlib.h

External variables are any variables defined outside of a given function and thus are avaliable to many functions
Functions are by default external because functions can't be defined in functions.

By default, external variables and functions have the property that all references to them by them
same name, even from functions compiled separately, are references to the same thing.
